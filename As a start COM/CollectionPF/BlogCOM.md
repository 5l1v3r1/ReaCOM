### Abusing the COM Registry Structure (Part 2): Hijacking & Loading Techniques
TL;DR
There are several ways that attackers can leverage COM hijacking to influence evasive loading and hidden persistence.  A few examples include CLSID (sub)key abandonment referencing, key overriding, and key linking.
There are several programs and utilities that can invoke COM registry payloads including Rundll32.exe, Xwizard.exe, Verclsid.exe, Mmc.exe, and the Task Scheduler.  In the traditional sense, any binary that resolves non-existent and/or unreferenced COM classes can be potentially influenced (e.g. hijacked) for “unintended” loading.
Hijacking COM server binaries introduces a few interesting use cases (e.g. MMC).  Attackers can leverage the -Embedding switch to open GUI binaries in a hidden manner.
Defensive considerations include implementing robust Application Whitelisting policies, monitoring for unsuspecting command line usage (e.g. “-Embedding”) with a deviation from the proper parent process (e.g. svchost.exe), and the creation of interesting Registry keys (e.g. “TreatAs”, “ScriptletUrl”, etc.).


### Background

Not long ago, I wrote a blog post about [Abusing the COM Registry Structure: CLSID, LocalServer32, & InprocServer32](https://bohops.com/2018/06/28/abusing-com-registry-structure-clsid-localserver32-inprocserver32/) In that previous post, a few interesting techniques were discussed such as abandoned registry key discovery, COM hijacking, lateral movement, defensive evasion, application whitelisting bypass, and situational persistence.  In this follow-up post, we will take it a step further and focus on a few other hijack methods and evasive loading techniques.  Topics include
