### This tool works on regulate and manage the ports configuration in operating system.
While I was looking for any tools that I can use them to hijack COM objects I found this tool works by using function that is used to COM techniques, after I found this tool (I understood that It can be used to hijack COM object)




We all know what happens when It's easy to hijack COM object, which It means that we can execute Scriptlet by using COM hijacking techniques.

As we see in the picture below, It shows how Scripting.Dictionary function invokes CLSID to execute load and execute Scriptlet remotely.
